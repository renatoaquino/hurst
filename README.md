# Hurst exponent

The Hurst exponent is used as a measure of long-term memory of time series. It relates to the autocorrelations of the time series, and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases.

This code tries to calculate this exponent using go code.

** Warning ** 
The exponent generated by this code wasn't correct the last time a checked (try the tests); this repo is here just as a backup of work.
